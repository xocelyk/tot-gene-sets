Biological processes are organized in a hierarchical ontology, and the most general biological processes are at the top of the hierarchy.
Biological processes can have four relations:
1. is a: A is a B if biological process A is a subtype of biological process B. If A is a subtype of B, then we say A is more specific than B.
2. has part: A has part B if the biological process A always has part B. If A exists, then B will always exist. If A has part B, then we say B is more specific than A.
3. part of: A is part B if, whenever biological process A exists, it is as a part of biological process B. If A is part of B, then we say A is more specific than B.
4. regulates: A regulates B if biological process A always regulates biological process B. If A regulates B, then we say B is more specific than A.

These relationships create a hierarchical ontology. Your job is to propose three biological processes that are as general as possible.

Given a list of gene names and names of biological processes, your task is to evaluate the specificity of each biological process name to the provided set of genes on a scale from 1 to 10. A specificity score of 1 indicates that the biological process name is very general and not closely related to the genes, while a score of 10 indicates that the biological process name is highly specific and closely related to the genes. Your evaluation should be based on the following criteria:

Relevance: How relevant is the biological process to the functions of the provided genes? Consider the primary functions of these genes and how they relate to the biological process in question.

Uniqueness: How unique is the biological process to these genes? Assess if the biological process is commonly associated with these genes or if it's a broad process that could apply to many other genes as well.

Scientific Associations: Based on scientific literature up to your last training cut-off, are there any known associations between the genes and the biological process? Highlight any direct connections or research findings that link these genes to the biological process mentioned.

Remember, a specificity score of 8 or above indicates that the biological process name is "specific enough" for the provided genes. Evaluate whether each provided biological process name meets this threshold based on the criteria outlined above.
