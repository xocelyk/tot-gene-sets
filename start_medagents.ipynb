For plant vegetative embryos, this would be from the initial determination of the cell or group of cells to form an embryo until the point when the embryo becomes independent of the parent plant.\" [GOC:go_curators, GOC:isa_complete, GOC:mtg_sensu]       1120          24                 23                  21010   0.958333  0.020536  query_1                                                  [GO:0007275]\\n300  GO:CC  GO:0005615                                       extracellular space  2.373654e-06         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \"That part of a multicellular organism outside the cells proper, usually taken to be outside the plasma membranes, and occupied by fluid.\" [ISBN:0198547684]       3284          24                 16                  22090   0.666667  0.004872  query_1                                      [GO:0005576, GO:0110165]\\n74   GO:BP  GO:0048706                     embryonic skeletal system development  1.604620e-13         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \"The process, occurring during the embryonic phase, whose specific outcome is the progression of the skeleton over time, from its formation to the mature structure.\" [GOC:dph, GOC:dsf, GOC:jid, GOC:tb, PMID:16049113]        128          24                 10                  21010   0.416667  0.078125  query_1                                      [GO:0001501, GO:0043009]\\n496  GO:BP  GO:1902533  positive regulation of intracellular signal transduction  1.164853e-03         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \"Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of intracellular signal transduction.\" [GOC:BHF, GOC:dph, GOC:signaling, GOC:tb, GOC:TermGenie]        972          24                  9                  21010   0.375000  0.009259  query_1                          [GO:0009967, GO:0035556, GO:1902531]\\n51   GO:BP  GO:0048568                               embryonic organ development  1.916695e-16         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \"Development, taking place during the embryonic phase, of a tissue or tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions.

For plant vegetative embryos, this would be from the initial determination of the cell or group of cells to form an embryo until the point when the embryo becomes independent of the parent plant.\" [GOC:go_curators, GOC:isa_complete, GOC:mtg_sensu]       1120          24                 23                  21010   0.958333  0.020536  query_1                                                  [GO:0007275]\\n300  GO:CC  GO:0005615                                       extracellular space  2.373654e-06         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \"That part of a multicellular organism outside the cells proper, usually taken to be outside the plasma membranes, and occupied by fluid.\" [ISBN:0198547684]       3284          24                 16                  22090   0.666667  0.004872  query_1                                      [GO:0005576, GO:0110165]\\n74   GO:BP  GO:0048706                     embryonic skeletal system development  1.604620e-13         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \"The process, occurring during the embryonic phase, whose specific outcome is the progression of the skeleton over time, from its formation to the mature structure.\" [GOC:dph, GOC:dsf, GOC:jid, GOC:tb, PMID:16049113]        128          24                 10                  21010   0.416667  0.078125  query_1                                      [GO:0001501, GO:0043009]\\n496  GO:BP  GO:1902533  positive regulation of intracellular signal transduction  1.164853e-03         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \"Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of intracellular signal transduction.\" [GOC:BHF, GOC:dph, GOC:signaling, GOC:tb, GOC:TermGenie]        972          24                  9                  21010   0.375000  0.009259  query_1                          [GO:0009967, GO:0035556, GO:1902531]\\n51   GO:BP  GO:0048568                               embryonic organ development  1.916695e-16         True                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \"Development, taking place during the embryonic phase, of a tissue or tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions.
