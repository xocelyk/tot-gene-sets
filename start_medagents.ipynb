As a genetics expert, I understand that these genes are involved in various biological processes and pathways related to development, cell signaling, and tissue homeostasis. The genes listed include those involved in embryonic development (SHH, BMP4, BMP5, FGF10, NODAL, HOXD13), cell proliferation and differentiation (EGFR, TP63, FGFR2, CTNNB1), bone development and maintenance (SOSTDC1, WNT2B, BMP7, WNT5A), and other processes such as metabolism (HIF1A, RDH10), and gene regulation (AR, OVOL2).\\n\\nBased on the genes listed, the two most prominent biological processes performed by the system appear to be embryonic development and cell signaling. These genes play crucial roles in regulating the development of various tissues and organs during embryogenesis, as well as in mediating cell-to-cell communication and signaling pathways essential for normal physiological functions.\\n\\nIn summary, the set of genes listed is involved in a wide range of biological processes, but the most prominent ones are likely to be embryonic development and cell signaling.', 'Molecular Biology': 'The question seems to be asking about the biological processes associated with the set of genes listed. The genes mentioned in the question are associated with various signaling pathways and developmental processes in molecular biology. The biological processes performed by the system of these genes can be related to embryonic development, cell signaling, and tissue differentiation.\\n\\nBased on the genes listed, two prominent biological processes performed by the system could be:\\n\\n1. Embryonic Development: Several of the genes listed, such as SHH, BMP4, FGF10, NODAL, and HOXD13, are known to play crucial roles in embryonic development, including limb development, organogenesis, and patterning.\\n\\n2. Cell Signaling: Many of the genes listed, including EGFR, WNT2B, BMP7, and FGF10, are involved in various signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis.\\n\\nThese biological processes are essential for normal development and homeostasis in the human body and are regulated by the intricate interplay of the genes mentioned.\\n\\nAs a molecular biology expert, I would emphasize that the functions of these genes are complex and interconnected, and they contribute to a wide range of biological processes beyond the two highlighted. Additionally, the specific roles of these genes can vary depending on the context and stage of development.', 'Developmental Biology': 'The question seems to be asking about the prominent biological processes associated with the set of genes listed. As a medical expert in developmental biology, I understand that these genes are involved in various developmental processes and signaling pathways. From the list of genes provided, it appears that the question is seeking to identify the key biological processes that these genes are involved in.\\n\\nUpon reviewing the list of genes, it is evident that many of them are associated with developmental signaling pathways, cell differentiation, and tissue patterning. The two most prominent biological processes performed by the system of genes listed are likely to be embryonic development and morphogenesis. \\n\\nEmbryonic development encompasses the processes involved in the formation and development of an embryo, including cell differentiation, tissue patterning, and organogenesis. Morphogenesis refers to the shaping of tissues and organs during development, involving processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the genes listed, it can be inferred that the two most prominent biological processes performed by the system are embryonic development and morphogenesis. These processes are crucial for the proper formation and organization of tissues and organs during development.', 'Oncology': 'It seems like you have provided a list of genes and are asking about the biological processes associated with these genes. As an oncology expert, I can interpret this question in the context of cancer biology. Many of the genes listed are known to be involved in various biological processes, including cell signaling, development, and differentiation, which are relevant to cancer biology.\\n\\nFrom the list of genes provided, the two most prominent biological processes performed by the system appear to be related to cell signaling and development. Several of the listed genes, such as SHH, BMP5, FGF10, EGFR, NODAL, FGFR2, WNT2B, and others, are known to be involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and development. Additionally, genes like HOXD13, CTNNB1, and LUZP1 are associated with developmental processes and tissue differentiation.\\n\\nIn the context of cancer, dysregulation of these biological processes can contribute to tumor development and progression. For example, aberrant activation of cell signaling pathways (e.g., EGFR, WNT) and disruption of developmental processes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\\n\\nTherefore, the two most prominent biological processes performed by the system of genes listed are cell signaling and development, both of which have implications for cancer biology.', 'Orthopedics': 'It seems like the question is asking about the biological processes associated with the set of genes listed. The genes mentioned in the question are associated with various signaling pathways and developmental processes. As an orthopedic expert, I can provide insight into the role of some of these genes in skeletal development and bone formation.\\n\\nFrom the list of genes provided, the two most prominent biological processes related to orthopedics would be skeletal development and bone morphogenesis. Several genes in the list are known to play crucial roles in these processes. For example, BMP4, BMP5, BMP7, and WNT signaling pathway-related genes (WNT2, WNT2B, WNT5A) are involved in bone development and maintenance. Additionally, genes such as SHH, NOG, and CTNNB1 are also associated with skeletal development and patterning.\\n\\nIn summary, the two most prominent biological processes performed by the system of genes listed would be skeletal development and bone morphogenesis, which are essential in the context of orthopedics.

As a genetics expert, I understand that these genes are involved in various biological processes and pathways related to development, cell signaling, and tissue homeostasis. The genes listed include those involved in embryonic development (SHH, BMP4, BMP5, FGF10, NODAL, HOXD13), cell proliferation and differentiation (EGFR, TP63, FGFR2, CTNNB1), bone development and maintenance (SOSTDC1, WNT2B, BMP7, WNT5A), and other processes such as metabolism (HIF1A, RDH10), and gene regulation (AR, OVOL2).\n",

These genes are involved in regulating various aspects of skeletal development, including bone formation, growth, and patterning.', 'GProfiler': '    source      native                                                                                    name       p_value  significant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           description  term_size  query_size  intersection_size  effective_domain_size  precision    recall    query                                                       parents\\n161  GO:BP  GO:0198738                                                              cell-cell signaling by wnt  1.544076e-09         True                                                                                                                             \"Any process that mediates the transfer of information from one cell to another, medaited by a wnt family protein ligand.
